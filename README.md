# Console-Based E-commerce Order Manager (C++ + Oracle SQL)

This is a personal project I built to simulate a basic e-commerce ordering system using C++ and Oracle SQL. It allows users to log in, browse products, add items to a cart, place orders, and track their order status — all through a clean command-line interface backed by stored procedures and a relational database.

## ✅ Features

- **Customer Login** – Simulates authentication using customer IDs
- **Product Lookup** – Validates products and prices from a SQL database
- **Dynamic Shopping Cart** – Users can add multiple products and quantities
- **Checkout Process** – Places an order and stores it using stored procedures
- **Order Status Viewer** – Allows customers to check or cancel existing orders
- **Modular Design** – All C++ logic split into clean header/source files

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your Oracle DB instance and import the `setup.sql` script
3. Update your Oracle DB credentials inside `main.cpp`:
   
   string user = "your_username";
   string pass = "your_password";
   string constr = "your_connection_string";

## 🚀 Why I Built This

I wanted to create a hands-on simulation of how an e-commerce backend might operate under the hood — from login and product lookup to cart management and order fulfillment. It helped me improve my skills in C++, SQL logic, and modular program design.
