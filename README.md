# Console-Based E-commerce Order Manager (C++ + Oracle SQL)

This is a personal project I built to simulate a basic e-commerce ordering system using C++ and Oracle SQL. It allows users to log in, browse products, add items to a cart, place orders, and track their order status â€” all through a clean command-line interface backed by stored procedures and a relational database.
